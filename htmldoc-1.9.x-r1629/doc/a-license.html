<h1><a name='LICENSE'>Appendix A - License Agreement</a></h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>HTMLDOC is distributed in both source code and binary
(executable) forms. The source code is provided under the terms
of the GNU General Public License ("GPL") with a license
exception for the OpenSSL toolkit. A copy of the source code
license can be found in the file <var>COPYING.txt</var> in the
source code distribution.</p>

<p>The binaries are provided under a typical commercial software
end-user license agreement which is more restrictive than the
GNU GPL.</p>

<h3>Source Code and the GNU GPL</h3>

<p>For those not familiar with the GNU GPL, the license basically
allows you to:</p>

<ul>

	<li>Use the HTMLDOC software and source code at
	no charge.</li>

	<li>Distribute verbatim copies of the software in source
	form or as binaries you create.</li>

	<li>Sell verbatim copies of the software for a media
	fee, or sell support for the software.</li>

	<li>Distribute or sell your own modified version of
	HTMLDOC so long as the source code is made
	available under the GPL.</li>

</ul>

<p>What this license <b>does not</b> allow you to do is make
changes or add features to HTMLDOC and then sell a binary
distribution without source code. You must provide source for
any changes or additions to the software, and all code must be
provided under the GPL.</p>

<h3>Trademarks</h3>

<p>Easy Software Products has trademarked the HTMLDOC
name. You may use the name in any direct port or binary
distribution of HTMLDOC. Please contact Easy Software Products
for written permission to use the name in derivative products.
Our intention is to protect the value of this trademark and
ensure that any derivative product meets the same high-quality
standards as the original.</p>

<h3>Binary Distribution Rights</h3>

<p>Easy Software Products also sells rights to the
HTMLDOC source code under a binary distribution license
for vendors that are unable to release source code for their
additions and modifications to HTMLDOC under the GNU GPL.
For information please contact us at the address shown
above.</p>

<h3>Binaries and Support</h3>

<p>Easy Software Products sells commercial HTMLDOC binaries and
support. You can find out more at the HTMLDOC commercial home
